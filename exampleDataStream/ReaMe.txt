RAW Data Block  ->    divide raw data into several data block
Raw Data length 
Raw Data Block length
Compressed Data  ->    Data that is compressed
Compressed DataBlock   ->  divide Compress Data into several data block
Compressed Data length 
Compressed Data Block length


The Compressed Data Flow Struct:
[ 8 Bytes Special Pattern ]    
[ 2 Bytes Compressed Data Header: 0x01 ] [ 2 Bytes Header Options:0x00 ] 
[ 4 bytes Raw Data length ] 
[ 4 bytes checksum = checksum(special pattern -> Raw data length) ] 
[ 4 bytes extra info ]

Compressed Data Block 1....N:
[ 2 Bytes Compressed Data Header: 0x11 ] [ 2 Bytes Header Options: it means compressed level for LZ77 ] 
[ 4 bytes Compress Block Data length ] 
[ 4 bytes checksum = checksum(Compress Block Data) ] 
[ 4 bytes extra info = Raw Data Block length ]
[ Compress Block Data ]
